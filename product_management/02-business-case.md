# 🧾 Operary – Business Case

> "A system of machines without a system of humans is not a system — it's a risk."

---

## 🧠 Executive Summary

**Operary** is a coordination engine for industrial operations that bridges machine triggers, human action, and shift-based continuity. It solves a critical gap in how large-scale operations manage real-time workflows across floor teams, systems, and compliance layers.

This business case outlines:
- The operational problems faced by industrial enterprises  
- The opportunity size  
- Why current tools fail  
- Why Operary is both urgent and inevitable  

---

## 🏭 The Problem

Despite massive investments in automation, SCADA, ERP, and MES tools, **human coordination remains fragmented**:

- Shift supervisors rely on verbal handoffs, WhatsApp, or Excel  
- Task ownership often fades between alert and action  
- Incident data is lost, unstructured, or never logged  
- Compliance requires manual backfill of logs — error-prone + time-consuming  
- Decision-making during downtime is ad-hoc

---

## 🔥 The Stakes

- **Untracked incidents** → legal, safety, and operational risk  
- **Inconsistent handoffs** → missed work, rework, accidents  
- **Poor traceability** → audit failure, ESG score impact  
- **High friction in ops** → low morale, shift fatigue, breakdown of trust

## 📈 Market Opportunity

| Segment | Why it’s hot |
|---------|---------------|
| Manufacturing 4.0 | Coordination is the missing layer in factory digitization  
| Utilities & Infrastructure | Decentralized teams need a single system of record  
| Aviation, Rail, Power | Safety + compliance + shift-based accountability  
| Energy Transition | ESG demands auditable behavior + digital SOPs  

### TAM/SAM (Directionally):

- $2B+ in workflow digitization for heavy industry  
- >500,000 sites globally using fragmented human coordination  
- Rising demand for **mobile-first ops tools** that integrate via API  

---

## 💡 Why Now?

- 📱 Frontline teams are now digital natives  
- 📡 Sensors and alerts are rich, but **human response isn’t tracked**  
- 🛠️ SCADA and ERP are **not built for people coordination**  
- 🔎 Post-COVID, **operational resilience** is a board-level concern  
- 🔐 Regulatory environments (ESG, OSHA, ISO) demand auditable trails

- Maintenance task orchestration with trace  
- Remote site coordination and trust layering  
- ESG-linked behavior capture + proof

---

## 📘 Alignment with Strategic Priorities

| Enterprise Priority | How Operary Helps |
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Digital Twin Enablement | Adds human event layer to digital models  
| ESG/Compliance | Proves intent and trace at action level  
| Operational Resilience | Surfaces and structures chaos under stress  
| Human-in-the-Loop | Elevates operators into accountable intelligence  
| API Economy | Enables full stack orchestration

## 🧭 Conclusion

> "Machines run the world. People keep it from breaking."

**Operary is not a ticketing system. It’s not a helpdesk.  
It’s an execution trust layer — for operations.**

It complements existing investments while solving a universally neglected gap:  
**How people actually respond to signals — in real time.**
