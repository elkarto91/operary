# 🛰️ Operary – Ideation & Market Discovery

> "Coordination isn’t just about what gets done — it’s about who sees what, when, and why."

## 🔧 What is Operary?

**Operary** is a coordination engine for frontline industrial operations.

It enables **real-time orchestration of tasks, escalations, and workflows** across machines, humans, and systems in industrial environments like smart factories, energy grids, utilities, and plant floors.

Unlike traditional workflow systems, Operary is:

- 🧠 **Context-aware** — Built for operations, not desktops  
- 🧭 **Execution-native** — Designed around machine + human inputs  
- 📡 **API-first** — Embeds into existing SCADA/MES/ERP infrastructure  
- 📘 **Audit-resilient** — Produces complete handoff + trace logs  

---

## 🏭 Why This? Why Now?

### 🚨 The Modern Ops Breakdown

1. Industrial operations have **machine-level intelligence** (SCADA, sensors), but...
2. Their **human coordination systems are brittle** — radios, clipboards, Excel, WhatsApp
3. SOPs exist, but **aren’t connected** to the moment
4. Shift changes **drop context** → loss of continuity
5. Task handoffs and incidents are **lost in narrative gaps**, not system gaps

**Result:**  
Downtime. Rework. Audit pain. Safety lapses. Decision latency.

## 📈 Market Trends

- 💡 **Rise of smart factories** → more systems, more fragmentation  
- 🔗 **API economy in industrial software** → Ops teams want pluggable solutions  
- 🔐 **Trust and traceability mandates** → compliance and ESG visibility  
- 🧠 **LLM/AI-as-assistant movement** → tools need explainability + observability  
- 📱 **Mobile-first frontline workforce** → shift managers, technicians, and responders work away from screens

## 🔎 Key Targets

### 🎯 Primary Clients

| Company | Why They Care |
|---------|---------------|
| **Siemens** | Leads in factory automation — wants trustable coordination for digital twins  
| **Bosch** | Deep in smart devices and manufacturing — but human workflows are fragmented  
| **Honeywell** | Strong SCADA presence — could integrate Operary as coordination middleware  
| **ABB / Schneider** | Integration-ready portfolios — crave context-rich orchestration layers

---

## 👥 Personas

### 👷 Operator
- Works on machines
- Needs clear shift tasks
- Tracks anomalies
- Wants visual, mobile alerts

### 🧰 Shift Supervisor
- Manages 4–10 operators
- Needs to reassign based on downtimes
- Logs handover notes

### 🛠️ Maintenance Engineer
- Handles escalations
- Tracks repetitive incidents
- Needs fast history + instruction links

### 📋 Compliance Lead
- Reviews logs post-facto
- Wants structured, explainable records
- Prepares reports for external audits

## 🔁 Related Solutions (but not the same)

| Tool | Why It’s Not Enough |
|------|----------------------|
| SAP PM / Maximo | Heavy. Not responsive to shift context or machine events.  
| WhatsApp / Excel | Ubiquitous but unauditable. No data.  
| Trello / Notion | Built for desktop logic, not shift-based workflows.  
| MES Systems | Siloed to manufacturing execution — not human ops coordination.  

---

## 🧭 Your Product Vision

> Operary is the **first system to treat human coordination as a real-time, API-accessible layer**, just like sensors or machines.

It:
- Accepts events from humans or systems  
- Routes tasks based on role, availability, escalation  
- Produces a traceable execution graph per shift  
- Plays well with legacy + cloud systems  
- Offers mobile-first views for operators and leads  
- Auto-generates shift reports + handoff summaries

---

## 🔮 What Success Looks Like

1. **Shift logs generate themselves**
2. **Audit trails are not manually created — they're inevitable**
3. **Context never dies between people, systems, or shifts**
4. **Plant leads operate on signal, not interruption**

---

## 🧱 Competitive Edge

- Not a ticketing tool  
- Not a MES clone  
- Not a desktop workflow tool

→ It's a **horizontal coordination system for vertical industrial teams**.
