# üõéÔ∏è Notification Services

This folder contains background and auxiliary services that operate outside the main request/response cycle.

The implementations here demonstrate how Operary could handle asynchronous
dispatch tasks alongside the REST API. While only a heartbeat notifier exists
today, the same pattern can be expanded to deliver webhooks, schedule jobs, or
stream events to other systems.

## `notification.go`

### Purpose:
A long-running background dispatcher that simulates future integration points with external systems, such as:

- Webhook pings
- Event streaming (Kafka, NATS, Redis Streams)
- Retry queue for failed deliveries
- Scheduled job execution

### How It Works:
- Runs as a goroutine in `main.go`
- Logs heartbeat every 15 seconds using Zap
- Prints idle queue status with timestamps

### Future Ideas:
- Use Mongo change streams to detect new audit/task events
- Push status updates to external ERP/MES or reporting systems
- Integrate with `OpenTelemetry` for trace-spanning events

## üì¶ Usage in Main

```go
import "operary/internal/services"

...

services.StartNotificationService(logger)
```

This ensures the dispatcher boots with your app and provides observability immediately.

The service runs in the background as soon as `main.go` starts, periodically
logging heartbeats to indicate that asynchronous tasks would be processed.

## Development Notes

These helpers are intentionally lightweight. Expand the dispatcher with message queues or extra logging as your experiments evolve.
